        <p>Incredible memories to this day remain...</p>

        <p><strong>April 5, 2022:</strong> Unforgettable day. At 7:03 PM, I had a conversation with a girl for the first time. She said we could go together... It was a dream come true, but at the same time, my friend Mano made fun of me.</p>
        <p>I didn't sleep that night... I couldn't. Thoughts kept swirling in my head. What if this was something more than a joke?</p>

        <p><strong>April 6, 2022:</strong> The next day, I couldn't stop thinking about it. My friends couldn't stop teasing me. But inside, I couldn't help but feel something special.</p>

        <p>The days that followed were full of conversations... There was something magical about those moments, something that I never expected to experience. She said, "Let's walk together," and I didn't know what to think. I never imagined something like this could happen to me.</p>

        <p>Mano said I was lucky... but I didn't know. I was just glad to have someone to talk to. And little by little, I learned to open up.</p>

        <p><strong>12th April 2022:</strong> Talked to her again, but not in class like usual. My mind was all over the place, unsure of what was going on. I still haven't figured it out...</p>

        <p><strong>15th April 2022:</strong> Still waiting for a response. Two days of holidays passed by, but there's still no word from her. My mind is full of questions. What should I do?</p>
